      In January of 2023, I was driving this car home from school and after turning into my neighborhood the oil light turned on. After taking it to a mechanic thay said the head gasket was blown and that it was not worth trying to fix, leading to the car sitting in a warehouse for 2.5 years. Online investigation revealed that a mass oil leak with this make and model, and it was easier to fix than the mechanics made it seem. The PCV Breather box, responsible for removing harmful blow-by pollutant gases from the system, was clogged with oil and blew the camshaft seals on the engine. In order to replace both the PCV Breather and the camshaft seals, much of the engine bay would have to be cleared out (seen below). Replacing the PCV box was simple enough, but the camshaft seals proved to be much riskier. The seals were behind the timing belt and gears, meaning everything had to be done perfectly. That is because this engine is an interference engine, meaning that the pistons and valves move at precise times to keep everything functioning correctly. If the timing was off even slightly, the whole engine could sieze and all work would be for nothing. To start, the exhaust and intake camshafts were locked into place, followed by the removal of the old seals. A specialty tool was used to ensure a proper seal, and then the engine could be retimed. After placing the belt back onto the pulleys, the system had to be hand cranked for a handful of rotations to ensure that the timing was set properly. Once this was ensured, the engine was fully rebuilt and the car was ready to be tested. It struggled to find life after sitting for so long but with the help of some started fluid it roared to life. However, in order to be a daily driver the car would have to pass an emissions check so that it could be re-registered. Unfortunatley, a check engine light showed up revealing that there was a leak in the evaporative emissions system, meaning we could not pass the e-check. To clear this light, the purge valve and many different spans of vaccuum tubing was replaced to ensure a seal on the system.

  - title: Lego Robot
    description: In Engineering Design Thinking II students were tasked with making lego robots that could follow a line, pick up and determine contents of a box, and place box in a location depending on its contents. 
    subtitle: For line tracking capabilities, my robot used two color sensors and a PD loop. The loop would take the sum of both sensors and compare that to the individual sensors. If the left sensor was reading black and the right white, the code would return a value that would turn the robot towards the line and then compare again after finish that run through of the loop.

    subtitle2: After developing line tracking, the robot needed to be able to know when it is in front of a box and pick it up. To do this, a button sensor was used to detect the box, and a simple 2 bar would lift up the box. The code behind this consisted of a P loop to supply power to the motor, and a summation of power compared to known values to dermine the contents.

    subtitle3: With working line tracking and weight determination, the last bit of functionality came from an ultrasonic sensor reading markers on the side of the track. Using a counter, the code would look at the value assigned to the contents and what marker number it was at to determine if the box should be dropped off in that location.

  - title: Simple Writing Tablet
    description: At the University of Cincinnati all students take a class called Engineering Design Thinking in which they are tasked with developing a product that will help struggling communities. 
    subtitle: My group chose to create a simple writing tablet to help the low literacy rates in the country of Nigeria. We used the design process to create a prototype consisting of a metal frame, sand, and clear polyvinyl chloride. To use the tablet, you would take a stylus and write as normal and see your writing in the sand. To erase your writing you would shake until the sand flattened. While the prototype may not have worked as well as we would have liked, it was a proof of concept and with more development it could be improved tremendously.
