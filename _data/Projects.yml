  - title: 2002 Volvo S60
    description: A catastrophic oil leak caused my 2002 Volvo S60 to become inoperable. A mechanic shop diagnosed the issue as a failed head gasket and recommended a used engine installation over a complicated and labor-intensive gasket replacement. Personal research indicated that head gasket failure was not a common issue on this engine. After personally completing a partial engine teardown and inspection, I determined that the PCV Breather Box was clogged causing camshaft seal failure. When replacing the camshaft seals, precautions had to be taken. This engine is an interference engine, meaning that the pistons and valves could come into contact if not timed properly, potentially causing total engine failure. To counteract this potential failure, I locked the camshafts into place, ensuring that the engine timing was maintained. Finally, the engine was manually turned to confirm proper engine timing before engine startup.

    description2: Once the car was determined to be fully functional, it needed to be reregistered. However, a small leak in the evaporative emissions system was highlighted due to a check engine light. To fix this, I replaced sections of compromised vacuum hose to ensure a proper seal within the system.

  - title: Lego Robot
    description: In my Engineering Design Thinking II class, we were tasked with making lego robots that could follow a line, pick up and determine contents of a box, and place the box in a location depending on its contents. 
    subtitle: For line tracking capabilities, my robot used two color sensors and a PD loop. The loop produces two quotients by taking the sum of both sensors divided by their individual values. The difference between these quotients is then multiplied by a constant, telling the robot to turn the calculated amount. This process repeats every few miliseconds for as long as the code is running. In simpler terms, if the left sensor reads black and the right sensor white, the code returns a value telling the robot to turn towards the line and compare values again.

    subtitle2: After developing line tracking, the robot needs to know when to pick up a box. To do this, a button sensor detects the box and a simple two-bar mechanism lifts it. To determine the contents of the box, the code uses a P loop that supplies power to the motor and a summation of power compared to known values.

    subtitle3: Now that the robot can move and determine what it is holding, it needs to know where it is located. To do this, an ultrasonic sensor detects a marker and adds a counter in the code. When the counter matches the number assigned to the box, it drops off the box and continues to follow the line.

  - title: Simple Writing Tablet
    description: Students in the Engineering Design Thinking class are tasked with developing a product that will help struggling communities. My group chose to create a simple writing tablet to help the low literacy rates in the country of Nigeria. We used the design process to create a prototype consisting of a metal frame, sand, and clear polyvinyl chloride. With a stylus, users write normally and see their text etched into the sand and can shake to erase. While the prototype did not work as well as we would have liked, it was a proof of concept and could be improved with more development.

  - title: Over Under
    date: May. 2023 - May. 2024
    heading: _Robot Build_
    description1: The objective of Over Under is to score triballs in goals and elevate your robot for varying point values. Teams are tasked with documenting the design, build, and programming of their robots and competing against teams from across the world.
    description2: Our robot for the Vex Robotics World Championship included 4 main subsystems – the drivetrain, the intake, the wings, and the hang.
    description3:
      - The drivetrain consisted of six 600 rpm motors with a gear ratio of 36:48 on 3.25” wheels, providing an output of ~365 rpm. This allowed the robot to move around the field quickly while being able to push opponents with minimal risk of burnout.
      - The intake was powered by two 600 rpm motors with a gear ratio of 60:36, providing an output of 1000 rpm. The speed, combined with the wide intake opening, allowed the robot to easily collect triballs from around the field and score efficiently. A one-way trapdoor allowed triballs to be loaded through the top while still letting them rest properly inside the robot.
      - The wings were powered with one pneumatic piston each, allowing the robot to manipulate numerous numbers of triballs in different ways.
      - To elevate the robot, two pistons activated, folding out a two-stage lift. Polycarbonate guides allowed the robot to slot into the climbing post. After alignment, a piston fired to connect a winch to the drivetrain. This allowed the hanging mechanism to use the power of all six drivetrain motors and elevate the robot approximately three feet into the air.. This mechanism proved to be crucial in how well we performed at the competition and it had no mechanical issues over its many matches.

    heading2: _Coding_
    description5: Matches consist of two main periods – the autonomous period and the driver control period. Since coding and tuning autonomous routines can be time consuming, I developed short-hand statements that streamlined the process and improved the readability of full-length codes. These short-hand statements allowed for complex autonomous routines to be created in minutes, allowing for more time spent tuning rather than writing.

    heading3: _Strategy_
    description7: The driver control period is heavily influenced by strategy. In this game, my team helped spearhead the change in strategy from shooting triballs across the field to carrying them across the field one by one. In scenarios where an opposing robot was driving towards us with large amounts of triballs we would try to prevent them from scoring by either pushing triballs out of play or stealing them for our use. In the last ten seconds of the match we would try to hang as quickly as possible. A full match can be seen in the video below.

    heading4: _Documentation_
    description8: Another part of the Vex Robotics Competition is judged awards. To earn these awards students have to fully document their design process and explain it in interviews. Linked [here](https://tinyurl.com/CameronMolina) is the notebook from my senior year.
