      - Required precise timing of engine to prevent fatal interference between pistons and valves.
      - Troubleshooted recurring check engine light relating to emissions system.

  - title: Lego Robot
    description: In Engineering Design Thinking II students were tasked with making lego robots that could follow a line, pick up and determine contents of a box, and place box in a location depending on its contents. 
    subtitle: For line tracking capabilities, my robot used two color sensors and a PD loop. The loop would take the sum of both sensors and compare that to the individual sensors. If the left sensor was reading black and the right white, the code would return a value that would turn the robot towards the line and then compare again after finish that run through of the loop.

    subtitle2: After developing line tracking, the robot needed to be able to know when it is in front of a box and pick it up. To do this, a button sensor was used to detect the box, and a simple 2 bar would lift up the box. The code behind this consisted of a P loop to supply power to the motor, and a summation of power compared to known values to dermine the contents.

    subtitle3: With working line tracking and weight determination, the last bit of functionality came from an ultrasonic sensor reading markers on the side of the track. Using a counter, the code would look at the value assigned to the contents and what marker number it was at to determine if the box should be dropped off in that location.

  - title: Simple Writing Tablet
    description: At the University of Cincinnati all students take a class called Engineering Design Thinking in which they are tasked with developing a product that will help struggling communities. 
    subtitle: My group chose to create a simple writing tablet to help the low literacy rates in the country of Nigeria. We used the design process to create a prototype consisting of a metal frame, sand, and clear polyvinyl chloride. To use the tablet, you would take a stylus and write as normal and see your writing in the sand. To erase your writing you would shake until the sand flattened. While the prototype may not have worked as well as we would have liked, it was a proof of concept and with more development it could be improved tremendously.
